<h3>Permissions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>At the time of a call into the system, to prevent an application from executing certain functions.</li>
  <li>When starting an activity, to prevent applications from launching activities of other applications.</li>
  <li>Both sending and receiving broadcasts, to control who can receive your broadcast or who can send a broadcast to you.</li>
  <li>When accessing and operating on a content provider.</li>
  <li>Binding to or starting a service.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Enforcing your own permission</h3>
<p></p>
<pre><code><permission android:name="com.me.app.myapp.permission.DEADLY_ACTIVITY"
  android:label="@string/permlab_deadlyActivity"
  android:description="@string/permdesc_deadlyActivity"
  android:permissionGroup="android.permission-group.COST_MONEY"
  android:protectionLevel="dangerous" /></code></pre>
  

- Activity permissions (applied to the <activity> tag) 
restrict who can start the associated activity.
- The permission is checked during Context.startActivity() 
and Activity.startActivityForResult(); 

- If the caller does not have the required permission then SecurityException is thrown from the call.



- Service permissions (applied to the <service> tag) restrict who can 
start or bind to the associated service. The permission is checked during 
Context.startService(), Context.stopService() and Context.bindService(); 
if the caller does not have the required permission then SecurityException 
is thrown from the call.


- BroadcastReceiver permissions (applied to the <receiver> tag) restrict 
who can send broadcasts to the associated receiver. The permission 
is checked after Context.sendBroadcast() returns, as the system tries 
to deliver the submitted broadcast to the given receiver. As a result, 
a permission failure will not result in an exception being thrown back 
to the caller; it will just not deliver the intent. In the same way, 
a permission can be supplied to Context.registerReceiver() to control 
who can broadcast to a programmatically registered receiver. 
Going the other way, a permission can be supplied when calling 
Context.sendBroadcast() to restrict which BroadcastReceiver objects 
are allowed to receive the broadcast (see below).

- ContentProvider permissions (applied to the <provider> tag) 
restrict who can access the data in a ContentProvider. 
(Content providers have an important additional security facility 
available to them called URI permissions which is described later.) 
Unlike the other components, there are two separate permission 
attributes you can set: android:readPermission restricts who can 
read from the provider, and android:writePermission restricts who 
can write to it. Note that if a provider is protected with both a 
read and write permission, holding only the write permission does 
not mean you can read from a provider. The permissions are checked 
when you first retrieve a provider (if you don't have either permission, 
a SecurityException will be thrown), and as you perform operations 
on the provider. Using ContentResolver.query() requires holding 
the read permission; using ContentResolver.insert(), ContentResolver.update(), 
ContentResolver.delete() requires the write permission. 
In all of these cases, not holding the required permission results 
in a SecurityException being thrown from the call.
